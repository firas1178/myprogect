        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.
</p>

 <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook the potatoes in boiling water for 8 mins. Add the green beans and cook for a further 3 mins, then drain.
</p>

 <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat the oil in a wok or pan, fry the garlic for 1 min, add the curry paste and cook for 1 min, or until it starts to darken a little and smell fragrant. Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer, drop in the lime zest and gently bubble for 5 mins to thicken the sauce a little.
</p>
